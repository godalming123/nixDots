# My neovim setup
## Keybinds
- `T`: file tagbar
- `ctrl` + `n`: show file manager
- `ctrl` + `t`: open a terminal
- `I`: insert an icon
- `ctrl` + `s`: search files in workspace
- `H`: search help manuals
### Comments
- use `gcc` to comment lines in normal mode
- use `gc` to comment lines in visual mode
### Splits
- use `ctrl` + `h, j, k, l` to change split focus
## Behaviors
I have designed this setup to stay out of my way so I can just edit code.
## Help
From within most menus you can type `?` to see a list of available bindings
